1. Total Order Quantity: 13.3K and total Revenue: $26.6M, suggesting strong revenue from these orders. The average revenue per order = $26.6M / 13.3K â‰ˆ $2,000 per order. This implies a high-value product/service or bulk purchases.
2. Total Profit: $8M and total Unit Cost: $4.2M. Profit Margin = (Profit / Revenue) Ã— 100 = (8M / 26.6M) Ã— 100 â‰ˆ 30%. The 30% profit margin is generally strong, indicating healthy pricing strategies and cost management.
3. Total Population: 892.1M and total Household Income: $320.5M. Average Household Income per Person = $320.5M / 892.1M â‰ˆ $359 per person. This suggests a market with moderate spending power, meaning pricing strategies should align with customer affordability.

2. It shows Positive Correlation: The higher the population and household income, the greater the transaction and income opportunities.


## Recommendations:
Based on the insights and findings above, I would recommend the Marketing & Sales Team to consider the following: 
1. **Delivery Time**: Build multi-warehouses in the states and understanding the state's regional areas to better identify the suitable types of shipping for each region.
2. **Revenue**: Countries with lower sales compared to those with higher sales for the same product should adopt the sales strategies of the countries with higher sales.
3. **Product & Demand**: The most popular items will be produced in larger quantities, while the less popular items will be discounted for clearance.
4. **Population & Household Income**: Partnering with local supermarkets, distributors, or online shops to increase product recognition with consument behavior approaches.
5. **Sales Performance**: Top-performing salesman can receive bonuses, while lower performers get benefit for training and sharing sessions with high-revenue achievers.


## Conclutions:
1. Delivery time is not affected by area size or climate, highlighting the need for optimized logistics & customized delivery methods for different regions.
2. The volume of order directly affects revenue; Therefore, the low-performing regions can adopt strategies from high-performing regions to improve their results.
3. Population size & household income both are influence  the demand of orders also revenue.
4. The higher product prices do not significantly affect demand of orders.
5. Build multiple warehouses, effective sales strategies, and local partnerships are crucial for improving sales in low-performing regions.
